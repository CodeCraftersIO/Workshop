#**Auto**Layout

---

#Problem to solve:

Laying out views when there are changes in:

	- Screen size
	- Rotations
	- Subview content
	- Internationalization
	- Dynamic Type
	- Size class

###*The logic used to design a set of constraints to create specific behaviors is very different from the logic used to write procedural or object-oriented code.*[^1]

##Let's back up a bit...

---

##"...the **constraint**-based system"

---

##"...the ~~constraint~~ **equation**-based system"

---

##AutoLayout is just an **equation system** where the variables are the **view's frames**

---

> Equation == Constraint

---

##A constraint is just an equation that expresses on an axis either:

- The distance between two sibling views
- The size of a view

---

#If we think about it:

```swift
view.leadingAnchor.constraint(
  equalTo: superView.leadingAnchor, 
  constant: 10
)
```

---
#Can be translated to[^2]:

$$
view.left == superView.left + 10
$$

##How many equations do we need?

Each view has to have a defined `frame`, which means:

- _origin_: `x`, `y`
- _size_: `width`, `height`

---

###You add enough constraints until the layout system can solve **all 4** variables for every view.

Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints
	Probably at least one of the constraints in the 
	following list is one you don't want. 

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint 
<NSLayoutConstraint:0x698e70 UIView: 0x698e43.width == 30   (active)>

```

---

##How to add constraints (responsibly):

1. A `UIView` should provide constraints for it's subviews positions
2. A `UIView` should provide it's size:
	- Using width and height constraints
	- Using `intrinsicContentSize`

---
##How to create constraints:

```swift
let widthConstraint = redView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30)
let heightConstraint = redView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 30)
```

And then:

```swift
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
  widthConstraint, 
  heightConstraint
])
```

---

#What happens next?

---

##Layout cycle

Adding a constraint will indirectly call `setNeedsLayout` to a view, triggering a layout pass where the layout system will:

- Finds the top-most view (normally visible's `UIViewController`'s view)
- Resolve the top-most view hierarhy using the screen size.
	- Positions and sizes for the top-most view's subviews will be resolved.
- The layout system will recursively resolve the subviews hierarcy based on the size of all the subviews.

---
##Layout cycle: customization

The layout system will call:

-`viewWillLayoutSubviews` on `UIViewController` 

-`layoutSubviews` on `UIView`

The resolved frame for the current view will be passed as an argument for customization.

**Don't** call `setNeedsLayout` during these methods.

#Demo

^ Create a sample UIViewController.
Create a sample UIView
Add it to view hierarchy using constraints
Remove size constraints, use intrinsic contentSize
The add a label, play with it for a bit

#Layout Guides

Defines a rectangular region where layout can occurr safely in their owning view‚Äôs coordinate system.

#Layout Guides

```swift
let layoutGuide: UILayoutGuide = ...
let constraints = [
	label.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: layoutGuide.leadingAnchor),
	label.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: layoutGuide.trailingAnchor),
	label.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: layoutGuide.topAnchor),
	label.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: layoutGuide.bottomAnchor)
]
NSLayoutConstraint.activate(constraints)

```
---

#Layout Guides

There are three types:

- Margin.
- SafeArea.
- Custom.

---

#Layout **Margins** Guides

Every `UIView` has one to reflect the `layoutMargins` property.

```swift
self.layoutMargins = UIEdgeInsets(top: 5, left: 5, bottom: 5, right: 5)
let constraints = [
	label.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.layoutMarginsGuide.leadingAnchor),
	label.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.layoutMarginsGuide.trailingAnchor),
	label.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.layoutMarginsGuide.topAnchor),
	label.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.layoutMarginsGuide.bottomAnchor)
]
NSLayoutConstraint.activate(constraints)

```

**Note:** you can't modify a `UIViewController`'s view's margins.

#Safe Area Layout Guide

Prevents showing content underneath:
- `UINavigationBar`
- `UITabBar`
- `UIStatusBar`
- iPhone X home indicator.


‚úÖ Automatically set for us on `UIViewController`
üëÄ Can be modified with `additionalSafeAreaInsets`

#Best practices:


---

# View layout

- From top to bottom on the view hierarchy.

- Create constraints and activate them all at once using `NSLayoutConstraint.activate()`.

- Don't create more constraints than you need.

- Rely on `intrinsicContentSize` for sizes when possible.

---
# `intrinsicContentSize`

- Your custom view's should not override this method
	- Instead, create constraints that will make the system infer it for you.

![inline](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTUPi.png)

---

# `UILabel.intrinsicContentSize`

- ‚õîÔ∏è *Never* constraint the width/height

- ‚úÖ Set `numberOfLines` to 0 and leading and trailing constraints instead of width.
- ‚òëÔ∏è Also, set `contentHuggingPriority` and `contentCompressionResistancePriority` appropiately.
 
---

# `UIImageView.intrinsicContentSize`

- It will default to the image's size
- Create a constraint for:
	- The `aspectRatio` 
	- The max allowed `aspectRatio`
	- The width or height.

---

# `UIStackView`

- Use `UIStackView` as much as possible.

- Remember that they don't have an `intrinsicContentSize`.

	- However, if the system can infer a width (vertical) or height (horizontal) for this stackView, then it uses the **fitting size** for this stackView:

```swift
let size: CGSize = stackView.systemLayoutSizeFitting(
    CGSize(width: 100, height: 0),
    withHorizontalFittingPriority: .required,
    verticalFittingPriority: .fittingSizeLevel
)
```

# Debugging

- Xcode's Visual Hierarchy debugger is your friend.

---

# Debugging

- Remember to turn of `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`.
- If a constraint is being broken by the engine, and the layout looks correct:
	- The engine did the right thing now, but this doesn't mean that it will do the same thing on other OS versions. 
	- Set that constraint's priority lower to optimize the performance. 

---

# Debugging

- Content sizes are also represented in the layout engine
