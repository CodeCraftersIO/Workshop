#Forms
### We will build a form to save a new GIF to Persistence layer.

#Forms

Forms have two separate concerns:

* The UI Layer
* The Data Layer

^
We must provide both ends.
We'll unit test both things

---

## UI Layer

- Typically, a list of views

- Usually scrollable

- Many different view kinds

---
## UI Layer

Allows the user to input things:

- Text (`UITextField`, `UITextView`, `UISearchController`)
- Touch interactions (`UISwitch`, `UIButton`)
- Redirections to other `UIViewController`s

---
## UI Layer

UIKit provides a range of tools to choose from:

- `UIView`
- `UIStackView`
- `UITableView`
- `UICollectionView`

All of them have its pros and cons.

---

## Regular UIViews with constraints
###Pros

* Straightforward of what you see
* Totally customizable (i.e. not vertically stacked)

###Cons

* Not scalable: 
	- $$elements ‚àù constraints$$
* Difficult to reason about (messy code)

---

## UIStackView
###Pros

* Straightforward to implement
* Easy to parametrize from the data layer (but not enforced)

###Cons

* Low performance on large forms
* Need to deal with the `UIScrollView`
* Only for iOS 9 and above

---
## UITableView (I)
###Pros

* Easy to scale
* Paves the way to parametrize with the data layer
* Form features built in (grouped table views, self-sizing cells)
* Performant for large forms

---
## UITableView (II)
###Cons

* Lots of boilerplate
* Only vertically stacked
* Not easily able to reach out specific UI elements

---
## UICollectionView
###Pros

* Highly customizable
* Easy to scale up or to parametrize from the data layer

###Cons

* Lots of boilerplate
* Form features **not** built in
* Not easily able to reach out specific UI elements

---
###TL;DR:
* For **reduced size** of forms or ones that will never grow (i.e. login), use UIStackView approach
* For **regular** forms, which can grow but are always stacked the same (i.e. personal data form)
* For **highly customized** forms _maybe_ consider UICollectionView
* Almost never consider regular UIView approach.

---
### Things to Consider
* UI for different form states
	* not validated || validated-ok || error
* Keyboard manager
* How to show the error state:
	* pointing the errors to the related fields
	* showing generic error (i.e. `UIAlertController`)

---
## Data Layer
We've got to design a data structure that supports our needs. Things to consider:

* Input elements
* Data hierarchy (i.e. iOS Settings)
* Data validation
	* Sync: Mandatory fields / email / credit card
	* Async: Validation of State/City

---
## Data Layer

A `class`, instead of `struct` or `enum`:

* It should be a single representation of the data
* We don't want to mess with sync problems

---

```swift
struct Form { ... }

class FormViewController: UIViewController {
	var form: Form {
		return self.formValidator.form
	}
}

class FormValidator {
	var form = Form()
}
```

##Separation of Concerns

Separate Model and UI in the different Modules we created

---

##Separation of Concerns
Data and UI: separated in the different Modules we created

... so we can test them separately

---

##Separation of Concerns
Data and UI: separated in the different Modules we created

... so we can test them separately

... so we can reuse them (i.e. watchOS/tvOS)
