# Soft Skills

Focus on Deliver results
Fix Bugs cleanly
Deal with Technical Debt
Play well with others
Know how to write


---

# Focus on Deliver results

Results
Focus
Deliver smaller results often

---

# What are **results**

>A result is something that makes a positive change in how the business works

It can be a feature, bugfix, documentation, or an answer to *anybody needing insight*

---

# What are **not** results

* An intermediate deliverable
* A progress report
* Anything outside the Definition of Done (i.e. tested)

---


# Focus

To keep focus on what you do

* Keep promises at minimum
* Take promises seriously
* Deliver small results more often


---

# Fix Bugs cleanly

Repeatable process

1. Understand the problem
2. Write tests that **fail**
3. Solve the problem
4. Refactor
5. Commit

---

# Understand the problem

Agile does not mean _just start coding_

* Navigate through the app to reveal the feature
* Ask the product owner or a colleague about the details of a feature or a bugfix
* Try to explain to them what you think you understood

---

# Write tests that fail

Should we loose time to write tests that fail?
>Top developers do not ask for permission to do their jobs

---

# Write tests that fail

It's a To Do list of the features

* Helps us check that we previously understood the problem
* Helps us identify corner cases

---

# Solve the problem
## ...as quickly as you can

Goal: make sure that the problem **can** be solved

* Code only what solves the problem
* Use tests to know when you have solved it

Once done, the work is **not** done, so we don't need to report your progress

---

# Refactor the code

Goal: Make the code readable and maintainable

* No copy-paste code
* Use *descriptive* variable names
* Coding style should *match* the previous one
* Make changes one at a time, re running tests to make sure it works


---

# Refactor - Comments

When we face a piece of code with comments, that is a place you might consider refactoring
Most of the times, good code does not need comments (but not always!)
Use comments to explain **why**, not **what**

---

# Commit your changes

Take special care to write a good message
*First line*: What the change is
*Other lines*:

- a link to the issue
- details about conversations about that
- explain why you did things, especially if done in an odd way

# Deal with Technical Debt

---

# Deal with Technical Debt

> Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

# What is **not** TECHDEBT === SLOP

* copy-pasted code, repeated elsewhere
* wrongly named variables/methods
* unused code

If it works, should you ship this code?

**NO**

# What is **not** TECHDEBT === SLOP

```swift
class Product {
	...
}

class Order {
	let customer: Customer
	let discounts: Float
	let product: Product

	var isFree: Bool {
		return customer.storeCredit + discounts >= product.price

		let discount: Float = code?.discounts ?? 0.0
		return customer.storeCredit + discounts >= price

# Why is SLOP bad?

Duplicates behaviors
Obscures the intent
Needs more training for future devs
	++ comments
	++ tests

---

# What **is** TECHDEBT

Code to fix later (or never)
Future-features, but not now-features
Tradeoffs taken in a controlled way

---

# What **is** TECHDEBT

```swift
class DiscountCode {
	let amount: Float
}

class OrderÂ {
	var discountsApplied: Float

	func applyDiscountCode(discountCode: DiscountCode)Â {
		discountsApplied += discountCode.amount
	}
}
```

---

# What **is** TECHDEBT

```swift
class DiscountCodeInteractor {
 	func isDiscountCodeValid(_ discountCode: DiscountCode) -> Promise<Bool> {
		/* code to talk to external service
		 * currently just checks if the code is valid and it wasn't used before
		 * should use the country of a discount code to validate */
		...
	}
}

class DiscountCode {
	let amount: Float

	func isApplicable(shippingAddress: Address) -> Promise<Bool> {
		/* TECHDEBT: we don't have promotions yet outside ES,
		 * and DiscountCodeInteractor hasn't the ability to check
		 * code based on its country, so we hardcode that for now
		 * should be fixed before adding discounts for other countries */
		return DiscountCodeInteractor.isDiscountCodeValid().map({ isCodeValid in
			isCodeValid && shippingAddress.country.code == "ES"
		})

	}
}
```

# Why TECHDEBT is **good**

No one knows what will be the shape of the code in the future

- when (if ever) will the feature be needed
- what constraints will a feature meet

...it allows to focus on what's important _now_
...it allows to ship one feature at a time (and only this)

# Play well with others



---

# Play well with others

We need a way to communicate with actual human beings
to do that, we need to

* Empathize with others
* Adapt Information
* Abstract Information

---

# Empathize with others

Understand people different from you:

* Managers
* Marketing
* Customers/App users

---

# Empathize with others

They don't know how to do what you do.

---

# Empathize with others

They don't know how to do what you do.
They don't have the vocabulary to know what to ask.

---

# Empathize with others

They don't know how to do what you do.
They don't have the vocabulary to know what to ask.
They don't know what they don't know, so they make *wrong assumptions*.

---

# Empathize with others

They don't know how to do what you do.
They don't have the vocabulary to know what to ask.
They don't know what they don't know, so they make *wrong assumptions*.

--

... but they are **not** stupid

---

# Empathize with others

They work on a totally different set of priorities

We need to to understand them
We need to make ourselves understood

We have to push back when asked to solve the *wrong problem*

...so we need to **adapt** terms and **abstract** concepts

---

# Adapt Terms

* Avoid technical jargon
* Use longer descriptive sentences instead of jargon
* Do not talk down
* Listen carefully to others, ask if you're not 100% sure


---

# Abstract Concepts

* Avoid technical details
* Explain things using analogies
* Use diagrams or sketches
* Repeat often the context of the discussion
* Be prepared to justify your position if challenged

---

# Know how to write
